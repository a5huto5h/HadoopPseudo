# Hadoop Pseudo-distributed Mode Installation
Shell script to download, install and configure Hadoop 2.9.1 in pseudo-distributed mode on Ubuntu 18.04.

Copy this script to your home folder and run it there. Hadoop will be installed and configured in the user's home folder. HDFS directory will also be created there.

I've used Oracle Java 8, which requires addition of the corresponding PPA. You may also run this script with OpenJDK 8 installed.

If you already have the hadoop binary \*.tar.gz file downloaded, put that in your home folder along with this script and then run the script.

Happy hadooping!
